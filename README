THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT DOES A LOT OF RANDOM THINGS.HOPEFULLY LATER IN LIFE I CAN USE THESE PACKAGES TO MAKE SOMETHING USEFUL

1.radio.py  ---THis is the one that listens to the streams and then adds the song to the database.

2.mp3.py --- Sends request to the website www.beemp3.com and then scrapes beemp3 links to the songs alongwith some other details and stores in database

3.mp4.py ---  The links got in the previous example are beemp3 encrypted.this one gets the actual links by using a combination of captcha solving and another software called imacros.

4.grive1.py --- uses the google drive sdk to store a backup of the /radio from the server to teh google drive.makes a tar ball of teh folder, uploads and then removes the folder.

5.radiostream.db --the main database storing everything.th schem is as follows

Songs Checked:5034	CREATE TABLE SongLink(File TEXT,Song TEXT,Artist TEXT,Album TEXT,Genre TEXT,Duration TEXT,Bitrate TEXT,Domain TEXT,Beeid TEXT,Dlink TEXT);
	      5043	CREATE TABLE Songs (Song TEXT UNIQUE, Stream TEXT);
			CREATE TABLE Stations(station TEXT UNIQUE, Genre TEXT);
			CREATE TABLE Urls(Beeid TEXT,Dlink TEXT);
